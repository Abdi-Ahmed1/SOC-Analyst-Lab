# SOC Analyst Lab

In this project, I am building a SOC Analyst Lab that serves as a controlled environment for testing and enhancing my skills as a SOC analyst. It provides a platform to simulate various security scenarios, enabling me to learn and develop effective strategies for detecting and mitigating threats. In future projects, I will leverage this SOC lab to explore a wider range of attacks, including phishing malware, ransomware, network intrusions, and other sophisticated threat vectors. By continually expanding my repertoire of attack simulations, I aim to strengthen my ability to safeguard organizations against evolving cyber threats.

## Project Highlights

- **Part 1: Building the Environment:** Set up a virtual environment with Linux and Windows virtual machines to replicate a SOC environment.
- **Part 2: Deploying a C2 Server:** Deployed a Sliver C2 server on Linux VM and established C2 sessions with a Windows VM for interactive control.
- **Part 3: Crafting Detection Rules:** Created custom detection rules using LimaCharlie to identify and generate alerts for malicious activities like credential dumping.
- **Part 4: Implementing Blocking Rules:** Enhanced detection rules to include response actions, such as blocking volume shadow copy deletion, as a proactive measure against ransomware attacks.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Setting up virtual environments for security testing and replication of real-world scenarios.
- Deploying and managing a Command and Control (C2) server to establish control over compromised systems.
- Creating and fine-tuning detection and response (D&R) rules using LimaCharlie for effective threat detection.
- Baseline analysis and tuning to minimize false positives and improve detection accuracy.
- Implementing blocking rules to prevent malicious activities and protect systems.
- Analyzing telemetry data and interpreting detection events for threat hunting and incident response.

## Technologies Used

- Virtualization: VMware, VirtualBox
- Operating Systems: Linux (Ubuntu), Windows
- Tools and Frameworks: Sliver C2, LimaCharlie, Sigma rules
- Networking: TCP/IP, SSH, HTTP



## Conclusion

The SOC Analyst Lab showcases practical skills in security operations, threat detection, and incident response. By leveraging LimaCharlie and other tools, this project provides valuable hands-on experience in setting up an environment, executing adversarial actions, and implementing effective detection and response mechanisms.

This project serves as a testament to my proficiency in SOC operations and demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and development in the field of cybersecurity.
